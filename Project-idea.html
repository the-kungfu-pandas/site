								<h3>Overview</h3>
								<p>Obesity is a severe problem consuming around 30% of the world’s population which is expected to increase over the course of years. This is because many people are not conscious of their health and among those who are conscious, do not know what path to follow. According to a survey, 58% of smartphone users have downloaded a fitness app. And among these, about 52 percent of users said they downloaded health apps to track physical activity, while 47 percent wanted to track what they ate. Forty-six percent said they downloaded health apps to lose weight and 34 percent said they wanted to use health apps to learn exercises. This clearly shows that people need different apps for different purposes Therefore, in order to reach out to people and guide them to the right path, we want to create an all-in-one fitness app.</p>
					
								<h3>Description</h3>
								<p> This app will not only take in account the exercising needs but will also provide diet plans along with calorie-tracking facilities and that too for free. There will be different exercising plans depending on the person’s goals which will not be solely constricted to the gym. For example, if a person wants to lose fat, then there will be a separate exercise plan for the fat loss. These different types of plans will contain videos to demonstrate the correct posture for a given exercise. These videos would contain some workout videos of professional bodybuilders. The videos will be suggesting the sets and repetitions required to do along with amount of calories burnt if followed the plan. In order to keep bringing in some variations within the workout, there will be exercises grouped according to a particular body part to give the customers independency to be able to choose the exercise themselves. Apart from this, each exercise type will elaborate what muscle group it targets along with the benefits.</p>
								<p>Moving on to the diet part, this is the main step towards achieving desired goals. There will be diet plans based, again, on the goals of an individual along with the calorie counts. The diet plan will undertake every meal including the cheat meals. If a person wants some variations in the diet, then there will be another section of all of the healthy foods. To make this dieting part much easier and at convenience, the meals that will be mentioned in the diet plans will also have recipes of how to prepare them. This will not only save the time of the customer as he or she won't have to look out for a recipe somewhere else but will also provide them a sense of surety as to what they are cooking is actually what's mentioned. If a person is further interested beyond the natural diet, this app will also provide them recommendations about health supplements like protein powders, pre-workouts, BCAA's , etc.</p>
								<p>Now for the tracking part, the app will be able to track the progress of a person depending on the plan chosen. Other than the gym exercises, it will also be able to track any other physical activity such as running, walking or swimming and give out the calories burnt as a result. It will include the calories required to intake in a day and amount of water needed per day.</p>
							
								<h3>Tool and Technologies Required</h3>
								<p>Various technologies and skills will be required for this task. Initially, computer programming in java or HTML5 in a certain workspace such as eclipse or bracket is the primary requirement so as to create an app for the android system. For an IOS, use of Multi-OS engine will be required. This is an open source technology that allows to create android and IOS apps in Java. This technology provides a stand-alone plug-in that integrates into Android Studio on Windows and/or Apple MacOS development machines.  Along with programming, designing and data managing skills will also help a lot for this app because a proper organization of things is what attracts more public. Software testing skills will also be put in use.</p>
								
								<h3>Hardware Requirements</h3>
								<p>For the app to run, various hardware have also to be used such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, compasses and GPS. Motion trackers are used to measure walking, running, cycling and swimming activities.  With the data collected, smartwatches and apps can calculate speed, cadence, distance traveled, and number of calories burnt. The hardware such as accelerometers, gyroscopes and compasses are already stacked in the smartphones.</p>
								
								<h3>Summary</h3>
								<p>To sum up, obesity basically comes through unorganized and over eating which will not persist anymore after the introduction of this app. This will eventually decrease the amount of diseases caused by obesity leading further to less deaths due to obesity. This app is for making people aware of their health and every person deserves to be having all the knowledge about staying fit without having to pay much for it.</p>
