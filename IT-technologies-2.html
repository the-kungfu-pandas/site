									<h4>What is Machine Learning</h4>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/img3.png" alt="" /></span>Machine Learning is the application of Artificial Intelligence that allows the automated analytical model building, ability to automatically learn and improve from experiences without being explicitly programed to do so, a branch of AI. To put it simply, it learn has the ability to learn like humans do.</p>
									<p>At the current state, Machine Learning is still a hard to touch upon subject, industries working with large amounts of data have recognized the value of machine learning technology, organisations that are able to fully incorporate machine learning into  their operations are able to work more efficiently, gaining an advantage over other competitors, this overwhelming advantage only highlights only little of its potentials.</p>
									<p>Machine Learning is a very complicated subject which requires experience and expertises to understand and to create. Machine Learning works by processing information through the use of algorithms deriving from a set learning style. All Machine learning consist of 3 main steps, Representation, Evaluation and Optimization. Through the representation process, this is the process of computer understanding the language. Furthermore, through the Evaluation stage, this is the basically setting a main goal for the Machine Learning in what it wants to achieve. And lastly the Optimization stage is the search method, it highlights what is the best and to be improved upon.</p>
									<p>Machine learning is versatile, meaning its able to be programmed to adapt to many forms of data and the output in which you want it to be working towards. Some of the industries which work with Machine Learning are the Healthcare industry, they utilise machine learning in the measurement of real time data through wearable devices and sensors that can assess a patient's health in real time, trends or red flags can be dissected through patients health, allowing to be learnt from transitioning into data which ultimately lead to improved diagnosis and treatment.</p>
									<p>One of the biggest and probably most seen of machine learning is in the retail industry. Have you ever had googled something or from a previous purchase and it becomes an advert suggested on across many websites. Retailers rely on Machine learning to capture data, analyse it and use it to personalize a shopping experience which will have a high chance of grasping the users attention and interest, this creates a massive competitive advantage for online retailers.</p>
									<p>One scary place where Machine learning has been applied is on Facebook. They have developed a system called “DeepFace’ a software algorithm that is able to recognize or verity individuals on photos on the same level as humans can.

In the near distant future, Machine learning will be very intricate and enhanced, many current limitations will be eliminated, for example language recognition. Machine Learning allow for the adaptation of how the person speaks by recognizing the movements of the mouth, and translating it into readable language. This allows the ability to differentiate dialects, accents, languages which could help severely in Security.</p>
									<p>Another interesting factor that Machine learning will have in the distant future is Autonomous vehicles. However we currently have autonomous vehicles such as Tesla however, it can still be flawed. Through Machine learning, The system will be more complex, allowing for it to identify pedestrians easier, street signs. Machine learning could be applied to how the vehicle accelerates on different surfaces allowing it to understand and evaluate safety.</p>
									<p>One massive factor in contributing to Machine Learning is the functioning capacity of  AI. AI allows the whole process of Machine learning to direct itself and gather data to contribute to on improving.</p>
									<h4>The impacts Machine learning would have</h4>
									<p>While Machine Learning continues to prosper, creating a more technological society for the better. The impact of Machine Learning would have in the future is immeasurable, some of the advancements are AI, as we continue to enhance our current knowledge of Machine Learning, we can implement this into AI to create self autonomous machinery, and even possibility of mimicking human interactions through AI.

As Machine Learning will take a huge impact on society, this will vastly affect the current jobs and create redundancy across many fields of industries. One example of the impact it will have is on data analytics, as Machine learning is able to comprehend the data more efficiently and effectively, it can be easily adjusted to suit the needs of the user and overall Machinery creates less human flaws which will significant benefit companies creating major redundancies. While Machine Learning will create redundancies in jobs, it will also open up new jobs in the management of Machine Learning, and other fields of Technology.</p>
									<h4>What would be affected through the implementation of AI</h4>
									<p>While Machine learning will have a big impact on the world, it will have its pros and cons. While the daily life is enhanced through the assistant of technology, we would become more and more reliant on the devices, rejecting real time social interaction furthermore. However, this can be replaced through the social media where people can feel more connected to the world than ever before, this could be a good thing however a bad thing as they live in the digital world.

While Machine learning will benefit the world and me, I would like to see it in action however the mystery of AI is incomprehensible and unpredictable to what effect it will have on the world and no i'm not talking about AI taking over but the disconnection to society.

My everyday interaction with technology will be significantly enhanced as i already spend a lot of time on my phone. Things like Siri will become more common and more advance, possibly developing a personality to suit the users personality to create a connection between the user to the AI.

The implementation of heavy Technology will create a divide in those who segregate and avoid technology, creating an isolated community where everyone is reliant on technology.

The interaction between my friends and family will become more distant as we would rely on technology to do the simple task such as communicating to each other becoming less genuine.
