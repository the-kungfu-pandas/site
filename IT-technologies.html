											<p>s3791766, Emails: s3791766@student.rmit.edu.au , ahswinters@outlook.com
I am Australian (predominantly English/German in background), My education to date includes Berwick Fields Primary School from 2006-2012, Kambrya College from 2013-2018, and RMIT 2019 - 2021 (hopefully). I am an avid gamer and enjoy watching anime, as well as reading manga in my spare time. I am a part of the RMIT Esports club, and currently the support/mid laner for a team in RMIT’s League of Legends tournament.  My friends and I often spend our weekends at Karaoke Bars when we want a break from university.  In terms of languages I speak English and basic German, however I'm studying Japanese language as an elective this year. My interest in IT began relatively late into my last year of high-school, due to changing friendship groups I became surrounded with people who had a passion for IT and gaming, which influenced my own passion for IT through constant exposure to it, and a fascination for how the internet, hardware, and software all works together in order to perform certain functions. Before starting Bachelor of Technology, I had little IT experience.

												<h2>Meng Zhao Li</h2>
											</header>
											<p>My name is Mengzhao (Mike) Li, and i was born in China and came to Australia at the age of 5 years old meaning i can both speak Chinese (Mandarin) and English fluently. My student number for RMIT University is s3785358 and my student email is s3785358@student.rmit.edu.au . Some of my hobbies include drawing, and playing video games from many categories, and often working out and spending most of my time indulging into the youtube and anime however not a weeb. My IT interest developed at a young age from the exposure to computer games, wonder how all the sophisticated components are capable to power an interactive video game. I went to Point Cook Senior Secondary college where i did Programming and formulated some knowledge on website design, information systems and the computer language Python. Ever since growing up, computers had been my second nature this allowed myself to easily interact with the computers interfaces.
