									<p>The group was great at meeting deadlines and there wasn’t any confusion on what everyone needed to do because everyone was set to their own part of the assignment. Communication throughout the group was clear and everyone was satisfied with their workload. Most of our work was done during our tutorials therefore discussion could take place if needed and it gave everyone the chance to speak up if they thought something wasn’t right. In case anything went wrong we created a group conversation on the social media platform Instagram where we could help each other out with their part or address any concerns if necessary. Overall the group worked efficiently and the assignment was completed without any major struggles. What I have learned from this group project is how important the planning phase is and making sure everyone understands what they are expected to do for the project to be completed smoothly.</p>

											<p>Everyone in the group was very supportive of the team members; we were giving bits of advice and encouragements toward each other. In the beginning, we knew that communication is the best way to reach a highly productive and efficient assignment. To help achieve this, our group had created a group chat on Instagram to get to know more about each member which improve trust in a relationship. Therefore our ability to come to an agreement or consensus on an issue is much easy to be solved. Apart from that, every group member had shown great enthusiasm for the assignment, and surprisingly had finished their works on time and effortlessly well. In the end, I have learned a lot from this group assignment, and I now know that work as a team is more productive and efficient rather than work on my own as an individual.</p>

												<h2>Chloe Henry</h2>

											<p>The group worked well together on getting the task completed, a group chat was made on Instagram to keep everyone up to date on what needed to be done and the due date for the assignment. The group as a whole worked efficiently in order to complete their assigned sections of the assignment, and any questions asked by an individual member of the group was answered by the members respectively without confrontation occurring between group members. Whilst not every group member was present for the occasional tutorial, each person pulled their weight and contributed to the assignment, ensuring it was completed to a high standard by the due date regardless of whether they missed a tutorial or not. The workload was divided evenly between group members, and each person selected their task to complete in order to be content the work they had to complete. The members helped each other out when stuck on parts of their tasks and figured out any issues that arose during the completion of this assignment.</p>

											<p>Everyone in our group corporate very well with each other, and the task at hand is handled with consideration and dissected into individual portion split among the group to smooth out the workload. Everyone completed their part to high standard and completed before the due date. All work is published on a google drive, accessible to all members making it easier for everyone to work with while simultaneously allowing for feedback. Everyone kept in contact with each on social media, a group was created on instagram and any queries and complications could be addressed in the group chat, this allowed everyone to stay connected and created an understanding of what everyone has completed up to. One surprising factor that arouse while working with the group is that how effectively the group gets along, by creating mutual interest and understanding of another's well being, the group task becomes easier to dissect as everyone felt at ease. I learnt that with groups, with right communication and teamwork, large projects can be broke up to pieces, making the workload possible.</p>

												<h2>Hajera Mohebzadah</h2>

											<p>In our group, everything went well with the Assignment 2, on 15/4/2019 in our tutorial class each one of us picked a section from Assignment 2 to do and getting started on it, and we made a shared google Drive for the Assignment 2, which we could see the work that have been done and for communication we made an Instagram group in case if any group member needs help with their part. We could improve our communication, like helping other group members with their section of work and if we have any ideas about their section we could contributed in their section. One surprising thing was that every group member contributed towards Assignment 2 and picked apart from the Assignment 2, rather than leaving it to the rest of group member to choose it for them, and one thing I learned about groups is that planning what needs to be done by each group member and by what date or time it needs to be done which mean it easy for the group to get started on the project. We made shared google Drive for our group which has a list of things need to be done by the group member and the section I and James did was Industry Data.</p>

											<p>The group work went pretty well and easy without any severe work load on any of the team member. The most surprising thing was that we all were quite clear as to what we individually need to do in order to contribute our parts towards the assignment without much arguments. Communication was never a problem as we made a group on Instagram in order to help each other out along with access to a group document in google drive and a group on github which helped each of us to keep a record on where the assignment has reached and edit certain things which, one feels, needed to be corrected. Github allowed us to track changes made by a group member in the website. Despite the fact that we all were confident of our parts, I feel that we all could have shown more involvement in each-others' parts as well. Also, I wanted people to put up their opinions much more clearly rather than just simply agreeing. Overall, working as a group was completely hassle-free and serene as long as the work gets distributed among the members who are determined to give their best. In this way, there is not much load of work and the work gets completed effectively as there is diversity of capabilities and brainstorming ideas.</p>
